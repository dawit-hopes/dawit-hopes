# 👋 Hi, I'm Dawit Abraham

Welcome to my backend and AI-focused GitHub space!

💻 I’m currently working as a **backend engineer** with a focus on:
- ⚙️ **Golang** — microservices, gRPC, Kafka, and clean architecture
- 📦 Distributed systems, event-driven design, and system reliability
- 🧠 **Machine Learning & Data Science** — using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn

This space is where I combine **robust backend engineering** with **intelligent data-driven solutions**.

---

## 🛠️ What You’ll Find Here
- Production-grade **Go microservices** with real-world patterns (hexagonal architecture, Kafka integration, etc.)
- Hands-on **ML projects** exploring data preprocessing, model training, and experimentation
- Tools and utilities I build to learn or solve problems in backend engineering and data science

---

## 🔍 Currently Exploring
- Kafka and asynchronous service communication
- Scalable backend system design
- Python pipelines for data processing and ML training

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Build smart, scalable systems that power real-world applications
- Master clean, testable Go code in complex systems
- Blend backend engineering and ML to solve meaningful problems
