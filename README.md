# 👋 Hi, I'm Dawit Abraham

Welcome to my AI-focused GitHub space!

🎯 I'm currently diving deep into **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, building a strong foundation in:
- 🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- 🧠 ML fundamentals & model building
- 🗃️ SQL for data analysis

🔬 This account is dedicated to sharing my learning journey through hands-on projects, notebooks, and experiments in AI and data science.

Stay tuned — more coming soon 🚀
